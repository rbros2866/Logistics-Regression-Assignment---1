In the context of logistic regression, where the goal is often to model the relationship between input features and the probability of a binary outcome, feature selection becomes crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward Selection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Process: Features are added to the model one at a time, starting with the most influential feature. At each step, the feature that contributes the most to the model's performance is added.\n",

    "Advantage: This method builds the model incrementally, considering the most relevant features first.\n",

    "Process: All features are initially included, and at each step, the least significant feature is removed from the model.\n",
